(Yeah, I know ANOTHER) and add the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-.json\">{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"presets\"</span>: [\n    [<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"env\"</span>, {\n      <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"targets\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"node\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}</code></pre>\n<p>So basically that tells babel, hey translate your stuff so even Node 4 and\nupwards can understand modules kthanksbai.</p>\n<p>Now adjust your scripts inside your <code>package.json</code> as follows:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-.json\">{\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"scripts\"</span>: {\n  <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"build\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"babel-node node_modules/.bin/webpack\"</span>\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>You can rename it accordingly but you get the drill. Basically we are\nrunning a version of babel that executes node stuff and it transpiles your stuff as well.</p>\n<p>Now just run <code>yarn run build</code> and much wow it works!</p>\n","__filename":"posts/how-to-use-es6-in-webpack.md","__url":"/posts/how-to-use-es6-in-webpack/","__resourceUrl":"/posts/how-to-use-es6-in-webpack/index.html","__dataUrl":"/posts/how-to-use-es6-in-webpack/index.html.207e2418c2811bf74ae35f78f08addd0.json"}
