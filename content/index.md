Hi there! Thanks for stopping by üëã

My name is Miguel Palau I'm a Web Developer from [Puebla, M√©xico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebla)

I love working with modern web technologies and I'm passionate about always staying sharp on my skills and learning new stuff all the time.

Also I enjoy working with and contributing to [open source](https://github.com/shelldandy/) and also I love tweaking my terminal and [dotfiles](https://github.com/mike3run/dotfiles)

Currently I work as a FullStack Developer at [Cratejoy](https://www.cratejoy.com/) where I do mostly [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) on the regular.

I organize a monthly Meetup in Puebla called [DevNights](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/DevNightsMX/) were we talk about open source technologies, eat some üçï and have a few üç∫. If you're around the area you should probably go üíÅ.

Ocassionally I [tweet](https://twitter.com/shelldandy) in a mix of spanish and english and write on [Pixel's Blog](https://www.pixel2html.com/blog/) and I'm also trying to blog more often here as well.

This webpage was built using [Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/) and its hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feel free to check the [source code](https://github.com/shelldandy/imike.pw)
